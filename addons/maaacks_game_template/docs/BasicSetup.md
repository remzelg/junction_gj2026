Depending on how the template was installed, or if any issues occurred, some of these may need to be run from the wizard to be completed.

The remaining steps are optional customizations.

## Scene Paths

The flow of scenes in the template is (by default):  
```
Opening -> Main Menu -> Game Scene -> Ending Scene
```

2.  Select the `Opening` root node.
3.  Update `Next Scene Path` to the desired path (`main_menu.tscn` by default).  
4.  Save the scene.

To change the _Game Scene_:

1.  Open `main_menu.tscn`.
2.  Select the `MainMenu` root node.
3.  Update `Game Scene Path` to the path of the project's game scene (`game.tscn` by default).  
4.  Save the scene.

To change the _Ending Scene_:

1.  Open `game.tscn`.
2.  Select the `LevelManager` node.
3.  Expand the `Scenes` Option Group in the Inspector.
4.  Update the optional `Ending Scene Path` to the desired scene (`end_credits.tscn` by default).  
5.  Save the scene.
